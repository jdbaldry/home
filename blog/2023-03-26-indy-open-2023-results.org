Indy is a climbing and bouldering gym in Anglesey, Wales.
Their website is https://www.indyclimbingwall.co.uk/.

On March 25th, 2023, Indy had an open climbing competition with the following rules:

- You can have unlimited tries and work sections.
- Problems finish matched (3 secs minimum) in the marked box on the top of the wall or the specified last hold.
- Each problem is worth 1000 points, the points are split between you and the number of people in your category that do that problem.
  If only you do it, you get the full 1000 points!
- Any specific rules will be written on the problem tags... ArÃªtes and volumes are always in unless stated otherwise.
- Please be extra careful today, keep landing areas clear, beware of other climbers around you, and most importantly... CRUSH!
- Please try and keep each other safe, warn people if they are walking into landing zones and try to field them to safety.


Although I did not compete in the competition itself, I attempted all the problems the next day and recorded my results.
